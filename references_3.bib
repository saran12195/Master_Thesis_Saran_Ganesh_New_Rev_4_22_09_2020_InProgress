	abstract = {The increasing penetration of the power electronic converter-based generation units in the electrical power system have given rise to many challenges to power system operation. Three of the most important challenges are the voltage control, frequency control and the grid restoration by the power electronic converter-based generation units in absence of conventional generation units. Moreover, the controllers of power electronic converter-based generation units can interact with the power system elements i.e. natural resonances and can cause the power system to be unstable.  
In this thesis, the effect of FSCG-, DFIG-based WTs and onshore as well as offshore HVDC systems is analyzed on the power system stability  considering the current grid codes. The dynamic response of the WTs and HVDC systems is studied considering the high share of the power electronic converter-based generation units. 
It is shown that the power electronic converter-based generation units based on the current grid codes cannot do proper frequency control in power electronic converter dominated grids due to the non-existent dynamic frequency control. The effective voltage control on the other hand is also not possible due to the absence of continuous voltage control. Moreover, the current injection based voltage control is not very effective in island and power electronic converter dominated grids. The restoration of the electrical grid WTs is also not possible due to the non-existent control strategies. It is also shown that the controller of the offshore HVDC converter can interact with the grid resonances if the grid resonances are not considered during the design of such a controller. 
New and modified control strategies are devised based on the active damping, direct voltage control and dynamic frequency control to help improve the dynamic behavior of the power system in power electronic converter dominated grids. A novel control approach for the restoration of the power system by the WT is also proposed and tested in simulations. 
In the end, the issue of the operational bottlenecks (overloading of electrical equipment) of the power system due to the integration of the power electronic converter-based generation units in the electrical power system , which causes the  re-dispatching of the electrical power, resulting in increased costs, is investigated. New innovative solution are suggested in this thesis to avoid the operational bottlenecks of the power system, thus reducing the re-dispatch costs and making it easier to integrate the renewable energies into the electrical power system.},

	abstract = {High penetration of wind power plants may have an adverse impact on power systems’ stability by reducing the inertia, and problems like frequency stability could appear due to total inertia in the system being reduced, making the power system more vulnerable to disturbances. However, most recent grid codes include an emulation inertia requirement for wind power plants, because modern wind turbines are capable of providing virtual inertia through power electronic converter controls to improve frequency stability issues. Because of this, it is necessary that the inertia estimation analyze and quantify the impact of the inertia reduction in power systems. In this paper, an implementation of a methodology for the inertia estimation of wind power plants is presented. It is evaluated through synchrophasor measurements obtained from a Real-Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) implementation, using industrial Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs). This methodology is based on the swing equation. Furthermore, a comparison of the results obtained between two professional tools RSCAD and DIgSILENT PowerFactory is performed, in order to evaluate the accuracy and the robustness of the methodology. This methodology is applied for the inertia estimation of an equivalent of the southeast zone of the Mexican power system, where there is a large-scale penetration of wind power plants. The results demonstrate that this methodology can be applied in real power systems using PMUs.},

The generator includes two back-to-back full-scale vector controlled 3-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) voltage-source-converters (VSC). A 47th order small-signal analytical wind generator model is developed within MatLab, and a summary of the model structure and controls is given. Model veriﬁcation is demonstrated for fast and slow system variables employing detailed simulation software PSCAD/EMTDC. An eigenvalue stability study for weak ac networks is presented, and qualitative conclusions about inherent system dynamics and stability characteristics are given. These insights are employed to study the design of an ac voltage controller for weak ac networks. Two alternative controller designs are studied for their potential to enhance system robustness to changes in ac grid strength. Testing on the detailed simulator PSCAD/EMTDC is employed throughout to conﬁrm conclusions from analytical studies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new concept for the grid integration of large-scale offshore wind farms. In the offshore wind farm, the wind turbines are integrated into the offshore DC collector grid by a cascaded converter. The high-voltage level for the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission purpose is built by series connections of low voltage modules, without the use of an offshore step-up substation. The output power of each module is controlled by the switching of the related half-bridge, and a modified straightforward voltage balancing strategy is proposed to balance the storage capacitor voltages in the turbines. Supplementary balancing strategies are also presented to assist in balancing the capacitor voltages, when the differences in the wind velocities flowing to the turbines become larger. Because of the stable capacitor voltages, self-commutated voltage source converter (VSC) is adopted as the onshore inverter station connecting the HVDC link and the onshore AC grid. The VSC station not only regulates the DC-bus voltage of the HVDC link, but also provides reactive power compensation to the onshore grid. The time-domain simulation results show that the proposed offshore wind-power collection and transmission system provides a new option for integrating large-scale offshore wind farms.

	abstract = {The development of efﬁcient and reliable offshore electrical transmission infrastructure is a key factor in the proliferation of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Traditionally, high-voltage AC (HVAC) transmission has been used for OWFs. Recently, voltage-source-converter-based (VSC-based) high-voltage DC (VSC-HVDC) transmission technologies have also been considered due to their grid-forming capabilities. Diode-rectiﬁer-based (DR-based) HVDC (DR-HVDC) transmission is also getting attention due to its increased reliability and reduced offshore platform footprint. Parallel operation of transmission systems using such technologies can be expected in the near future as new OWFs are planned in the vicinity of existing ones, with connections to more than one onshore AC system. This work addresses the control and parallel operation of three transmission links: VSC-HVDC, DR-HVDC, and HVAC, connecting a large OWF (cluster) to three different onshore AC systems. The HVAC link forms the offshore AC grid, while the diode rectiﬁer and the wind farm are synchronized to this grid voltage. The offshore HVDC converter can operate in grid-following or grid-forming mode, depending on the requirement. The contributions of this paper are threefold. (1) Novel DR- and VSC-HVDC control methods are proposed for the parallel operation of the three transmission systems. (2) An effective control method for the offshore converter of VSC-HVDC is proposed such that it can effectively operate as either a grid-following or a grid-forming converter. (3) A novel phase-locked loop (PLL) control for VSC-HVDC is proposed for the easy transition from the grid-following to the grid-forming converter in case the HVAC link trips. Dynamic simulations in PSCAD validate the ability of the proposed controllers to ride through faults and transition between grid-following and grid-forming operation.},

BESSs can also be used to store electricity during low-price hours, when the demand is low, and to meet the demand during peak hours, thus leading to savings for the consumer. This work focuses on the economic viability of BESS from the point of view of the electricity customer. The analysis refers to a lithium-ion (Li-ion), an advanced lead-acid, a zinc-based, a sodium-sulphur (NaS) and a ﬂow battery. The total investment and replacement costs are estimated in order to calculate the cumulated cash ﬂow, the net present value (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR) of the investment. A parametric analysis is further carried out under two different assumptions: a) varying the difference between high and low electricity prices, b) varying the peak demand charges. The analysis reveals that some electrochemical technologies are more suitable than others for electric bill management applications, and that a proﬁt for the customer can be reached only with a signiﬁcant difference between high and low electricity prices or when high peak demand charges are applied.},

A comparative analysis of various design options for the electrical collector system of large offshore wind farms is presented, and the advantages and disadvantages in terms of their steady-state performance and economics are discussed. The case under consideration is that of a proposed 1-GW wind farm located off the northeast coast of Scotland. The impact on power losses and voltage level changes on the collector system busbars are investigated under various operating conditions. Contingency conditions of losing one of the cables to the hub end are also explored for collector system designs with redundant cables.

	abstract = {In the recent years, the worldwide grid integration of renewable energy sources (RES) has grown rapidly. However, the grid-integration of large volume of renewables like wind and solar, interfaced by power electronics converters, is changing the dynamics of the power system and creating challenges to maintain reliability, robustness and stability of electricity supply. Morevoer, the stronger inter-linking of networks poses a greater risk of wide-area blackouts. With the growing share of wind power in the grid and conventional generators being phased out, large offshore wind power plants (OWPP) with state-of-the-art wind turbines (WT) can provide services of blackstart and power system restoration (PSR) in the future. This paper provides an overview of the technical requirements of blackstart units and the current capabilities of WTs, based on grid-codes, studies on ancillary services and recent blackout experience. Finally recommendations to the functional requirements of WTs are made, to make OWPPs capable of blackstart and help facilitate PSR in the future.},

	abstract = {The displacement of synchronous generators with inverter-based sources in the electric grid can results in larger frequency deviations due to lower rotating inertial energy. Existing grid-tied inverters operate as grid-following sources that track the voltage angle of the grid to control their output. Even with inverter fast frequency support, frequency regulation still depends on the remaining synchronous generators. In contrast, grid-forming sources actively control their frequency output, making it possible for them to naturally support the system frequency while sharing a portion of the load change. In this work, the impact of grid-forming and grid-following inverter controllers on the system frequency dynamics is studied and compared. A simple two-source system is modeled, and the small-signal dynamic characteristics are studied at various penetration levels and varying levels of mechanical inertia. The resulting eigenvalue trajectories are presented and these analytical results are validated by the corresponding timedomain plots. The results exhibit significant dynamic response advantages of the grid-forming inverter over its grid-following counterpart, particularly under the most demanding conditions when the penetration level of inverter-based sources reaches high levels and the available system stored inertial energy drops.},

The paper compares selected gridforming converter control strategies against each other and against state-of-the-art grid following control as well as against the behaviour of a synchronous generator and ideal voltage and current sources, by simulation test cases with small example networks. The main objective is to identify the core of gridforming behaviour, by the same time to identify the mechanism that may inhibit stable operation of power systems with high PE penetration. The results underline the need of grid-forming controls in cases of PE dominated power systems and indicate that only the control designs which show a strong initial response within a quarter period following on changes in terminal voltage magnitude or phase angle can supply a power system with high penetration of PE in a satisfactory manner. A definition of grid-forming behaviour is introduced, and possible tests for grid-forming behaviour suggested.},

	abstract = {The development of efﬁcient and reliable offshore electrical transmission infrastructure is a key factor in the proliferation of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Traditionally, high-voltage AC (HVAC) transmission has been used for OWFs. Recently, voltage-source-converter-based (VSC-based) high-voltage DC (VSC-HVDC) transmission technologies have also been considered due to their grid-forming capabilities. Diode-rectiﬁer-based (DR-based) HVDC (DR-HVDC) transmission is also getting attention due to its increased reliability and reduced offshore platform footprint. Parallel operation of transmission systems using such technologies can be expected in the near future as new OWFs are planned in the vicinity of existing ones, with connections to more than one onshore AC system. This work addresses the control and parallel operation of three transmission links: VSC-HVDC, DR-HVDC, and HVAC, connecting a large OWF (cluster) to three different onshore AC systems. The HVAC link forms the offshore AC grid, while the diode rectiﬁer and the wind farm are synchronized to this grid voltage. The offshore HVDC converter can operate in grid-following or grid-forming mode, depending on the requirement. The contributions of this paper are threefold. (1) Novel DR- and VSC-HVDC control methods are proposed for the parallel operation of the three transmission systems. (2) An effective control method for the offshore converter of VSC-HVDC is proposed such that it can effectively operate as either a grid-following or a grid-forming converter. (3) A novel phase-locked loop (PLL) control for VSC-HVDC is proposed for the easy transition from the grid-following to the grid-forming converter in case the HVAC link trips. Dynamic simulations in PSCAD validate the ability of the proposed controllers to ride through faults and transition between grid-following and grid-forming operation.},

	abstract = {With an increasing capacity in converter-based generation to the modern power system, a growing demand for such systems to be more grid-friendly has emerged. Consequently, grid-forming converters have been proposed as a promising solution as they are compatible with the conventional synchronousmachine-based power system. However, most research focuses on the grid-forming control during normal operating conditions without considering the fundamental distinction between a gridforming converter and a synchronous machine when considering its short-circuit capability. Current limitation of grid-forming converters during fault conditions is not well described in the available literature and present solutions often aim to switch the control structure to a grid-following structure during the fault. Yet, for a future converter-based power system with no or little integration of synchronous machines, the converters need to preserve their voltage-mode characteristics and be robust towards weak-grid conditions. To address this issue, this paper discusses the fundamental issue of grid-forming converter control during grid fault conditions and proposes a fault-mode controller which keeps the voltage-mode characteristics of the grid-forming structure while simultaneously limiting the converter currents to an admissible value. The proposed method is evaluated in a detailed simulation model and veriﬁed through an experimental test setup.},

	abstract = {Grid-forming inverters usually use inner cascaded controllers to regulate output AC voltage and converter output current. However, at the power transmission system level where the power inverter bandwidth is limited, i.e., low switching frequency, it is difficult to tune controller parameters to achieve the desired performances because of control loop interactions. In this paper, a direct AC voltage control-based state-feedback control is applied. Its control gains are tuned using a linear quadratic regulator. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is proposed to choose the right cost factors that allow the system to achieve the imposed specifications. Conventionally, a system based on direct AC voltage control has no restriction on the inverter current. Hence, in this paper, a threshold virtual impedance has been added to the state-feedback control in order to protect the inverter against overcurrent. The robustness of the proposed control is assessed for different short-circuit ratios using smallsignal stability analysis. Then, it is checked in different grid topologies using time domain simulations. An experimental test bench is developed in order to validate the proposed control.},

Thus, the changing generation proﬁle in the power system necessitates the use of alternate sources of energy such as wind power plants, to provide blackstart services in the future. This however, requires grid-forming and not the traditionally prevalent grid-following wind turbines. In this 5 paper, four different grid-forming control strategies have been implemented in an HVDC-connected wind farm. A simulation study has been carried out to test the different control schemes for the different stages of energization of onshore load by the wind farm. Their transient behaviour during transformer inrush, converter pre-charge and de-blocking, and onshore block-load pickup, has been compared to demonstrate the blackstart capabilities of grid-forming wind power plants for early participation in power system restoration.},

To balance the generation of power with the load demand, an intermediate circuit voltage control is used. Based on this concept, an alternative speed-power controller is designed to replace the MPPT based speed control in the process of blackstart and restoration. Furthermore, the definition of the frequency in an island grid is discussed. The overall control approach is presented and evaluated based on electromagnetic transient type simulations, involving islanding, load pick up, restoration, and resynchronization.},

In such conditions, system behaviour will dramatically change, but stability will still have to be ensured with the same level of reliability as today. To reach this ambitious goal, the control of inverters will have to be changed radically. Inverters will need to move from following the grid to leading the grid behaviour, both in steady state and during transients.

The considered design methodology is aimed to overcome the shortcomings of classical design methodologies, namely, stable operation under different grid conﬁgurations and conditions. Compared to previous works, the proposed design methodology allows the achievement of robust LCL ﬁlter design with regard to large grid impedance variations without the use of any damping method. Also, it takes into account accuracy of capacitor standard values and proposes a simple design method for the converter side inductor that avoids saturation problems. An example of LCL ﬁlter design is presented and discussed. The obtained ﬁlter parameters were ﬁrstly tested using a Matlab-Simulink software tool. After that, they were tested through the development of an experimental set-up. The obtained simulation and experimental results show the reliability and efﬁciency of the proposed design methodology.},

However design of LCL filter’s parameter not only relates switch frequency ripple attenuation, but also impacts on performance of grid-connected current controller. This paper firstly introduced a harmonic model of LCL filter in grid-connected operation, then researched the variable relationship among LCL filter’s parameter and resonance frequency and high-frequency ripple attenuation. Based on above analysis a reasonable design method was brought out in order to achieve optimal effect under the precondition of saving inductance magnetic core of LCL filter, at the same time guaranteeing the resonance frequency of LCL filter was not too small lest restrict current controller resign. Finally this design method was verified by the experimental results.},

This paper presents a novel hybrid converter topology with smaller passive components, composed of a high power main converter with an integrated low power active ﬁlter. The presented coupled control strategies for a current-source and a voltage-source topology enable the immediate mitigation of the switching frequency current ripple, signiﬁcantly decreasing the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output current to below 0.5 \% and thereby eliminating the need for a passive LCL-ﬁlter. Compared to LCL-ﬁlter based converter systems, a reduction of the inductive component expenditure of up to 50 \% is achievable even for a very low active ﬁlter to main converter power rating ratio of 10 \%. The outstanding harmonic performance and reduced passive component demand of the hybrid converter allow increased power density and efﬁciency as well as lower costs of low- and medium voltage power converters.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a step-by-step procedure for designing an LCL ﬁlter for grid-interactive converter while addressing the limiting constraints like maximum allowable ripple component in grid-side current, converter side ripple current, range of allowable resonant frequency, size of ﬁlter capacitor, harmonics in voltage proﬁle during stand-alone mode and limit on total inductance in ﬁlter. Primary goal of restricting the harmonic components in current fed to the grid (gridtied mode) or output voltage (stand-alone mode) within limits speciﬁed by stringent standards such as IEEE 519-1992, IEEE P1547-2003 and IEEE 446-1995 is achieved while adhering to the aforementioned constraints. The ﬁlter design is optimized by considering the worst case harmonics which could occur in three phase inverter. This design approach yields compact ﬁlter compared to traditional design procedures, which do not account for the cancelations of carrier band harmonics in three phase inverters. The trade-off between selection of resonant frequency and harmonic attenuation has also been explained quantitatively. The proposed method also takes into account that the harmonic pollution in capacitor voltage has to be restricted below 5\% THD in the event of islanded operation of converter. The proposed design algorithm is veriﬁed with simulation studies of a 5kVA, 220V 3-φ grid-interactive inverter.},

The introduced model combines an improved subconductor method for the determination of the frequency-dependent parameters and a PI section wave propagation model. The subconductor method considers the skin and proximity effect in all conductors for frequency ranges up to few megahertz. The subconductor method method yields accurate results. The wave propagation part of the cable model is based on a cascaded PI section model. A modal transformation technique has been used for the calculation in the time domain. The frequency-dependent elements of the related modal transformation matrices have been ﬁtted with rational functions. The frequency dependence of cable parameters has been reproduced using a vector ﬁtting algorithm and has been implemented into an resistor-inductor-capacitor network (RLC network) for each PI section. The proposed full model has been validated with measured data.},

	abstract = {Signal injection method (SIM) is widely applied to the insulation parameters’ measurement in distribution network for its convenience and safety. It can be divided into two kinds of patterns: injecting a specific frequency signal or several frequencies’ groups, and scanning frequency in a scheduled frequency scope. In order to avoid the disadvantages in related researches, improved signal injection method (ISIM), in which the frequency characteristic of the transformer magnetizing impedance is taken into consideration, is proposed. In addition, optimization for signal injection position has been accomplished, and the corresponding three calculation methods of lineto-ground capacitance has been derived. Calculations are carried out through the vector information (vector calculation method), the amplitude information (amplitude calculation method), the phase information (phase calculation method) of voltage and current in signal injecting port, respectively. The line-to-ground capacitance is represented by lumped parameter capacitances in high-voltage simulation test. Eight different sinusoidal signals are injected into zero-sequence circuit, and then line-to-ground capacitance is calculated with the above-mentioned vector calculation method based on the voltage and the current data of the injecting port. The results obtained by the vector calculation method show that ISIM has a wider application frequency range compared with signal injection method with rated parameters (RSIM) and SIM. The RSIM is calculated with the rated transformer parameters of magnetizing impedance, and the SIM based on the ideal transformer model, and the relative errors of calculation results of ISIM are smaller than that for other methods in general. The six groups of two-frequency set are chosen in a specific scope which is recommended by vector calculation results. Based on ISIM, the line-to-ground capacitance calculations through the amplitude calculation method and phase calculation method are compared, and then its application frequency range, which can work as a guidance for line-to-ground capacitance measurement, is concluded.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the design of a comprehensive inverter-BESS primary control capable of providing satisfactory performances both in grid-connected and islanded conﬁgurations as required by international standards and grid codes, such as IEEE Std. 1547. Such control guarantees smooth and fast dynamic behavior of the converter in islanded conﬁguration as well as fast power control and voltage-frequency support in grid-connected mode. The performances of the proposed primary control are assessed by means of EMT (ElectroMagnetic Transients) simulations in the dedicated software DIgSILENT PowerFactory® (Germany, Gomaringen) . The simulation results show that the proposed BESS (Battery Energy Storage System) primary control is able to regulate frequency and voltage in Grid-Forming mode independently of the number of paralleled generators. This is achieved adopting a virtual generator technique which presents several advantages compared to the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed control can be switched to Grid-Support mode in order to provide fast control actions to allow frequency and voltage support as well as power control following the reference signals from the secondary level.},

Due to the fast dynamics of such sources, the system is in many cases not quasi-static, and cannot be accurately described by time-varying phasors. In such systems the classic power ﬂow equations do not apply, and alternative models should be used instead. In this light, this paper offers a tutorial on the dynamics and control of power systems with distributed and renewable energy sources, based mainly on the dq0 transformation. The paper opens by recalling basic concepts of dq0 quantities and dq0-based models. We then explain how to model and analyze passive networks, synchronous machines, three-phase inverters, and how to systematically construct dq0-based models of complex systems. We also highlight the idea that dq0 models may be viewed as a natural extension of time-varying phasor models, and discuss the correct use and validity of each approach.},

The replacement of the offshore Voltage Source Converter (VSC) by a passive DR leads to major research questions pertaining to the control of the offshore AC grid. To achieve stable wind farm operation, many grid forming solutions have been devised. This paper reviews a few of the major control solutions for AC grid forming and operation of DR-HVDC based OWFs. Then these solutions are compared based on their approach in solving the major challenges involved. Then two of the solutions are selected for implementation in a study case electrical architecture. Using the simulation results and further analyses, the approaches adopted by these two solutions are elaborated further and the various challenges of DR-HVDC based OWF technology are highlighted.},

	abstract = {The future ‘SuperGrid’ may requires the benefit of both offshore AC network and multi-terminal DC grid. AC cable limits the power transfer capability from the larger offshore wind farm, however, HVDC transmission system is economical viable for large power wind farm integration with the grid. Another approach to develop the offshore network infrastructure is by forming an offshore AC grid connecting several offshore wind farms. Then, this offshore AC network is connected with different onshore grid using HVDC system. This enhances the trade among the countries as well as provide an economical solution for wind energy integration. In this article, operational and control concept of voltage source converter is presented to integrate an offshore AC grid with an offshore DC grid. The article presents the control principle of offshore AC network frequency and voltage with respect to active and reactive power distribution in the AC network. Later, the principle of multi-terminal HVDC system is discussed with respect to power distribution using DC voltage droop control. Power distribution criteria are defined with respect to operator power-sharing requirement and network stability. In the end, a hybrid AC/DC offshore grid is modelled and simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK to validate the distribution criteria.},

A V-I-f characteristic is derived to establish the relationship between the frequency deviation and dc voltage. A VSC-station working with the V-I-f characteristic is able to adjust its dc voltage reference autonomously according to the grid frequency deviation. Thus, the power ﬂow of the VSC-MTDC system will be redistributed and more power is going to be injected into the adjacent grid of which the frequency deviation exceeds the threshold value. The ADC strategy inherits the advantage of the traditional droop control (TDC) that there is no need for communication system. An ac/dc hybrid system that includes VSCMTDC system, onshore grids, and offshore wind farms is built in DIgSILENT/Powerfactory. Modal analysis and nonlinear simulations are performed to obtain the optimal control parameters and demonstrate the performance of the ADC strategy.},

However, it is still a problem to control the converter to achieve the function of each AC system sharing the reserve capacity of the entire network. This paper proposes an improved control strategy based on the slope control of the DC voltage and AC frequency (V–f slope control), in which the virtual inertia is introduced. This method can ensure that each AC sub-system shares the primary frequency control function. Additionally, with the new control method, it is easy to apply the secondary frequency control method of traditional AC systems to AC/DC hybrid systems to achieve the steady control of the DC voltage and AC frequency of the whole system. Most importantly, the new control method is better than the traditional control method in terms of dynamic performance. In this paper, a new control method is proposed, and the simulation model has been established in Matlab/Simulink to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.},

This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting conﬁgurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed.},

To this end, the Dutch government has very ambitious plans to create new wind sites far from shore and integrate that power generation to the high-voltage power grid in the next years. Due to the challenges of connecting future massive amounts of offshore wind power into the grid TenneT operates it becomes urgent to investigate new alternatives for this purpose. A grid topology with transmission capacities above 1 GW connecting offshore wind farms at distances close to 100 km in a standardized, modular, and cost-efficient manner is the focus of this thesis. \&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;With eight point-to-point HVDC links in operation in Germany and more expected in near future, TenneT TSO is analysing new offshore grid connection concepts to achieve a reliable and secure operation of the infrastructure connecting wind energy both in Germany and the Netherlands. A solution is presented in this thesis report in which new wind farms are connected with 66-kV cables to a centralised platform with a connection capacity of 1050 MW. This platform will utilise HVDC technology based on VSC conversion techniques and MMC topology. It is expected that the 66-kV cables will not be connected to a single busbar through paralleled converter transformer, but that this will be done with at least three converter transformers connected to each other on the valve side but not connected on the 66-kV side.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;A dynamic performance study of a test network with the novel connection topology developed in PSCAD has been done. Each component of the system was studied to obtain a complete overview and understanding of the overall behaviour. All the associated control loops for the MMC terminals and wind turbines were modelled in detail. Through several simulations based on eight cases and scenarios the performance of the offshore 66-kV ac grid and the MMC-HVDC link using the control schemes of MMC converters as in a typical grid connection topology for OWFs was assessed.\&lt;br/\&gt;},

This paper analyses the frequency support characteristics of MMC-based multiterminal HVDC schemes, using the energy transferred from the capacitance of the MMCs, wind turbine rotating mass and other AC systems. A generic formulation of an equivalent synthetic inertia constant is proposed to determine the energy transferred from the MTDC scheme. A 3-terminal MMCHVDC system is utilised to study the inﬂuence of cell capacitance of the submodules and the proposed synthetic inertia constant of the MTDC system on the frequency support capability of the MMC capacitors.

Wind farms are usually located far from the loads for minimal disturbances and optimal power generation. High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission is the preferred bulk power transmission system over long distances due to the minimal transmission losses, low costs and reduced environmental impacts. In this research investigation, a 690V, 2MW wind turbine equipped with a PMSG is modelled to be integrated into a local 33kV AC grid via a 2-level VSC-based HVDC transmission system. Three control schemes are implemented on the proposed system: a blade-pitch-angle controller applied on the wind turbine model, a field-oriented rotor speed controller applied on the rectifier for maximum power extraction, and a vector-oriented direct-current-link voltage controller applied on the grid-side inverter to keep the DC-link voltage constant and to ensure unity power factor. The proposed subsystems are implemented in MATLAB/Simulink and simulations are carried out to analyze the overall system’s performance.},

Therefore, a so-called grid forming control scheme is required. The control scheme used in this paper is based on direct voltage control. To balance the generation of power with the load demand, an intermediate circuit voltage control is used. Based on this concept, an alternative speed-power controller is designed to replace the MPPT based speed control in the process of blackstart and restoration. Furthermore, the definition of the frequency in an island grid is discussed. The overall control approach is presented and evaluated based on electromagnetic transient type simulations, involving islanding, load pick up, restoration, and resynchronization.},

The primary objective is to control the sharing of the active power transmitted by a multiterminal voltagesource converter based high voltage direct current network among a number of onshore ac grids or offshore loads based on the desired percentage shares. The shared power is generated by remote generation plants (e.g., offshore wind farms) or is provided as surplus from ac grids. The desired percentage shares of active power are optimized by the system operator in order to fulﬁl the active power requirements of the connected grids with respect to meeting goals such as supporting energy adequacy, increasing renewable energy penetration, and minimizing losses. The control strategy is based on two hierarchal levels: voltage-droop control as the primary controller and an optimal-power ﬂow based secondary (supervisory) controller for selecting the optimal droop reference voltages. Based on the dc voltage transient and steady-state dynamics, a methodology for choosing the droop gains for droop controlled converters has been developed. The proposed control strategy has been validated through simulation on the CIGRE B4 dc grid test system. The results conﬁrmed the ﬂexibility and effectiveness of the power-sharing control provided by the new control strategy.},

Even if they provide more and more ancillary services to the grid, these may not be sufficient for extremely high penetrations. As the share of such generating units is growing rapidly, some synchronous areas could in the future occasionally be operated without synchronous machines. In such conditions, system behaviour will dramatically change, but stability will still have to be ensured with the same level of reliability as today. To reach this ambitious goal, the control of inverters will have to be changed radically. Inverters will need to move from following the grid to leading the grid behaviour, both in steady state and during transients. This new type of control brings additional issues on converters that are addressed in this study. A solution is proposed to allow a stable operation of the system together with a limited solicitation of inverters during transients.},

It is shown that the voltage will rise by approximately 30\% within 50-100 ms in the ensuing island operation. The process is superimposed by transients caused by short but repetitive periods of saturation of the transformer resulting in excitation of the resonance frequency between transformer and cable capacitance predominantly in the zero sequence. It is demonstrated that in EMT type simulation the phenomena can be reproduced provided that the wind turbine control and the saturation of the transformer are properly modelled. A simulation tool has been used to demonstrate the effect of the level of wind farm loading at the instant of islanding on the observed phenomena.},

As is well-known, converters link renewable based power generation plants as well as voltage source converter based high voltage DC transmission lines (VSCHVDC) to the main grid. Using conceptual analysis supported by simulation results on a representative test network, it is shown that current injection control, as it is implemented in almost all wind turbines (WT) controls at the moment, is not suitable in grids dominated by converter in-feeds such as offshore wind farms. A new WT as well as VSC – HVDC control concept, which determines the converter reference voltage directly without the need for an underlying current controller, has been proposed. Additionally, alternative options for frequency support by the HVDC terminals that can be incorporated into the active power control channel have been presented and discussed. Simulation results show that the control approach fulfils all the operational control functions in steady state and in contingency situations supporting fault ride-through and emergency frequency support, without encountering the problems arising from current injection control.},

Measurements in real large WFs show that the voltage will rise by approximately 30\% within 50–100 ms in the ensuing island operation. The process is superimposed by transients caused by short but repetitive periods of saturation of the transformers. Based on the analysis of common wind turbine (WT) control concepts, it has been found that the reason for the voltage rise is the integral characteristic of the classical current controller. Generally, it seems that the current injection control, as it is used in almost all WT controls, is not suitable in grids dominated by converter in-feed like in OWF. The authors are suggesting a new WT control concept that is characterized by voltage injection instead of the usage of an explicit current controller. Simulation results show that the voltage rise following islanding can be avoided, whereas the fault ride-through response to grid short circuits remains almost the same as before.},

The growing demand for the green energy has forced investors in power industry to look for resources further out at sea. Hence, the development of power electronics and industrial engineering has enabled offshore wind farms to be situated further from the shore and in deeper waters. However, their development will require, among other technologies, DC-DC conversion systems. The advantages of HVDC over HVAC technology in relation to transmission distance are given. The different HVDC conﬁgurations and topologies of HVDC converters are elucidated. In this context, the HVDC grids are a promising alternative for the expansion of the existing AC grid.},

The paper also presents a discussion on the global harmonization of international grid codes as well as future trends expected in the regulations. Finally, the evolution of different wind generator technologies to fulﬁll various grid code requirements is investigated. The presented study will assist system operators to establish their connection requirements for the ﬁrst time or to compare their existing regulations with other operators. It also enables wind turbine manufacturers and wind farm developers to obtain a more precise understanding from the latest international requirements imposed on modern wind farms.},

They also make it possible for wind farm to become active element in the power system. The traditional frequency converter is back-to-back connected two-level converter, in which the output voltage has two possible values. However, the output voltage is smoother with a three-level converter, where output voltage has three possible values. This results in smaller harmonics, but on the other hand it has more components and is more complex to control. In this paper we study the different three-level converter topologies and make a cost and power loss comparison between the two-level and three-level converters.},

The paper compares selected gridforming converter control strategies against each other and against state-of-the-art grid following control as well as against the behaviour of a synchronous generator and ideal voltage and current sources, by simulation test cases with small example networks. The main objective is to identify the core of gridforming behaviour, by the same time to identify the mechanism that may inhibit stable operation of power systems with high PE penetration. The results underline the need of grid-forming controls in cases of PE dominated power systems and indicate that only the control designs which show a strong initial response within a quarter period following on changes in terminal voltage magnitude or phase angle can supply a power system with high penetration of PE in a satisfactory manner. A definition of grid-forming behaviour is introduced, and possible tests for grid-forming behaviour suggested.},

The subconductor method considers the skin and proximity effect in all conductors for frequency ranges up to few megahertz. The subconductor method method yields accurate results. The wave propagation part of the cable model is based on a cascaded PI section model. A modal transformation technique has been used for the calculation in the time domain. The frequency-dependent elements of the related modal transformation matrices have been ﬁtted with rational functions. The frequency dependence of cable parameters has been reproduced using a vector ﬁtting algorithm and has been implemented into an resistor-inductor-capacitor network (RLC network) for each PI section.

	abstract = {Signal injection method (SIM) is widely applied to the insulation parameters’ measurement in distribution network for its convenience and safety. It can be divided into two kinds of patterns: injecting a specific frequency signal or several frequencies’ groups, and scanning frequency in a scheduled frequency scope. In order to avoid the disadvantages in related researches, improved signal injection method (ISIM), in which the frequency characteristic of the transformer magnetizing impedance is taken into consideration, is proposed. In addition, optimization for signal injection position has been accomplished, and the corresponding three calculation methods of lineto-ground capacitance has been derived. Calculations are carried out through the vector information (vector calculation method), the amplitude information (amplitude calculation method), the phase information (phase calculation method) of voltage and current in signal injecting port, respectively. The line-to-ground capacitance is represented by lumped parameter capacitances in high-voltage simulation test. Eight different sinusoidal signals are injected into zero-sequence circuit, and then line-to-ground capacitance is calculated with the above-mentioned vector calculation method based on the voltage and the current data of the injecting port. The results obtained by the vector calculation method show that ISIM has a wider application frequency range compared with signal injection method with rated parameters (RSIM) and SIM. The RSIM is calculated with the rated transformer parameters of magnetizing impedance, and the SIM based on the ideal transformer model, and the relative errors of calculation results of ISIM are smaller than that for other methods in general. The six groups of two-frequency set are chosen in a specific scope which is recommended by vector calculation results. Based on ISIM, the line-to-ground capacitance calculations through the amplitude calculation method and phase calculation method are compared, and then its application frequency range, which can work as a guidance for line-to-ground capacitance measurement, is concluded.},

The complete formulation for the parameterization of the model is presented in detail, which allows an easy reproduction of the presented model. The validation of the model is performed via a comparison with a well-established reference model, the Universal Line Model (ULM) from PSCAD/EMTDC software. Two cable system case studies are presented. The ﬁrst case study shows the response of the FDPi Model for a three-core submarine cable. On the other hand, the second case study depicts the response of three single-core underground cables laying in trefoil formation. This last case shows the applicability of the FDPi Model to other types of cable systems and indirectly validates the response of the aforementioned model with experimental results.

A simple mathematical πequivalent cable model is presented and explained. The model is compared to the detailed cable models with different degrees of accuracy found in PSCAD/EMTDC. The models are analyzed and tested using simulations of dc fault conditions and energization. These studies are helpful for the protection system design of large-scale renewable energy power systems to realize a reliable multi-terminal dc transmission system for the future.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new control approach for load pick and restoration of power systems by full converter based wind turbines. In such blackstart scenarios, batteries or other storage devices that can establish frequency or balance generation and consumption of power are not necessarily available. Therefore, a so-called grid forming control scheme is required. The control scheme used in this paper is based on direct voltage control. To balance the generation of power with the load demand, an intermediate circuit voltage control is used. Based on this concept, an alternative speed-power controller is designed to replace the MPPT based speed control in the process of blackstart and restoration. Furthermore, the definition of the frequency in an island grid is discussed. The overall control approach is presented and evaluated based on electromagnetic transient type simulations, involving islanding, load pick up, restoration, and resynchronization.},

	abstract = {This paper ﬁrst presents the phenomena of the offshore wind farm (OWF) experience following the blocking of the high voltage direct current converter used for connecting the wind farm (WF) to the main onshore grid. Measurements in real large WFs show that the voltage will rise by approximately 30\% within 50–100 ms in the ensuing island operation. The process is superimposed by transients caused by short but repetitive periods of saturation of the transformers. Based on the analysis of common wind turbine (WT) control concepts, it has been found that the reason for the voltage rise is the integral characteristic of the classical current controller. Generally, it seems that the current injection control, as it is used in almost all WT controls, is not suitable in grids dominated by converter in-feed like in OWF. The authors are suggesting a new WT control concept that is characterized by voltage injection instead of the usage of an explicit current controller. Simulation results show that the voltage rise following islanding can be avoided, whereas the fault ride-through response to grid short circuits remains almost the same as before.},
