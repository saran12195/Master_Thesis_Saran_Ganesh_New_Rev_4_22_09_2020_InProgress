\chapter*{Acknowledgement}

There are many people to thank for the successful completion of my thesis. Firstly, I would like to thank Dr. Jose Rueda Torres for providing me with this opportunity to work on such an interesting topic and guiding me throughout the research. His inputs and suggestions have been extremely valuable. All the constructive criticisms through his comments for my report and presentations has helped in developing me as a good researcher and a good human being. My sincere gratitude to Prof. Mart van der Meijden for believing in me and for the constant support. He has always made me aware of the bigger picture of the work I was doing. I am incredibly thankful to both my supervisors for their support and goodwill during this thesis. Moreover, I thank Dr. Thiago Batista for being a part of my thesis committee and taking time to review and assess my work.  

I am indebted to my daily supervisor Arcadio Perilla for holding the torch to light my path all along this uphill journey. %He has been a constant support and a pillar of strength throughout my thesis project. 
I am grateful for all the discussions, explanations and proposed ideas for the successful completion of this project. He has been a great teacher to me from the start of my thesis and this work would not have been possible without his help and contribution.
