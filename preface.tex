To meet the European climate target of 27\% by 2030 in a cost effective way, large scale offshore wind energy proves to be a vital solution for the Netherlands. On the other hand, the implementation of large scale offshore could also lead to an increase in the penetration of power electronic converter based units in the grid which could lead to rise of challenges to the power system.

After analyzing the need for 66 kV \gls{HVAC} transmission from the wind farms to the offshore centralized platform, in this thesis, a 66 kV offshore network with an enhanced control strategy in Type-4 Wind Generators (\gls{WG}s) is developed in RSCAD. The control strategy provides continuous voltage control that improves the dynamic performance of the power system. The significant requirement of reactive power injection by the \gls{WG}s during dynamic conditions as mentioned in many grid codes is also satisfied by the controller. The working of the control strategy is validated for \gls{EMT} simulations under severe dynamic conditions by developing a similar network in PowerFactory with a benchmark controller model. The final goal of developing a large scale network with a defined topology for 2 GW is achieved in a modularized approach in RSCAD. In this network, four sets of \gls{WG}s are connected across two offshore Modular Multi-level Converters (\gls{MMC}s) working in two different control schemes and the coordination between the implemented voltage control in \gls{WG}s and the control structures in \gls{MMC}s is analysed for different events in the network.

The international association consisting of TenneT, Energinet, Gausine and Port of Rotterdam is working on developing technical solutions for supplying clean energy from renewable energy sources in large scale. This includes offshore wind farms power capacities ranging from 70 to 150 GW by 2040 and increasing upto 180 GW by 2045. This calls for the need of solutions for deployment of power from offshore wind farms in large scale.
